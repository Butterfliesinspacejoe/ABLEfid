This project is about reimagining how we think about DeFi and how we can use and leverage web3 to support those who need the help the most. People with Disabilities as defined by Social Security, who receive benefits such as SSI and SSDI are subject to limitations on how much money and assets they can have, capped at somewhere around the $2000 range, which as we know, is not enough to cover the cost of living in most parts of America. Able Accounts are an option for those who cannot afford a Lawyer to create a Special Needs Trust to shield them from the potential of losing their benefits, however many people receiving SSI and SSDI are low income and as a result not fortunate enough to be able to afford a Lawyer, this limits them to an ABLE account or “Achieving a Vetter Life Experience” account, in which funds deposited can be used for things such as disability expenses and rent and not count towards the Social Security Asset Limits, however for example in NY the savings account option has a annual rate of return yield of zero percent. This weekend also marks the 90th anniversary of the creation of the SSA. We need to rethink how we are using DeFi and Stablecoins so that we can use this technology to help people who can benefit the most from it, but that does  not necessarily mean creating a new technology, but instead reshaping our mindsets around how we use the tools we already have, as well as having better and stringer advocacy and representation of those who need to be better represented in the web3 space, this means strict regulation and compliance around stablecoins and upgrading our systems to support them, while also fostering adoption on an institutional level. If we can speed up the payment rails, increase the yields and rates of returns and do so in a way that all parties are in a win/win scenario, which is pretty easy to do when the APR for a savings account is 0%, then we absolutely should be doing so. Web3 is about helping people and making the world a better place, if we allow it to be. We have the technology, so lets use it!
