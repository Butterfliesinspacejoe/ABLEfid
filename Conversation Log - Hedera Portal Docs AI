help me to convert USDC to USDC on Hedera
To convert USDC to USDC on Hedera, if you mean transferring USDC tokens from one account to another on the Hedera network, you can use the Hedera Token Service (HTS) to perform a token transfer. This is a straightforward operation and does not involve any actual "conversion" since the token type remains the same—you're simply moving USDC from one account to another.
Here’s how you can do it using the Hedera SDK (JavaScript example):

const transferTx = await new TransferTransaction()
    .addTokenTransfer(usdcTokenId, senderAccountId, -amount) // Sender sends USDC
    .addTokenTransfer(usdcTokenId, receiverAccountId, amount) // Receiver receives USDC
    .freezeWith(client);

// Sign with the sender's private key
const signedTx = await transferTx.sign(senderPrivateKey);

// Execute the transaction
const txResponse = await signedTx.execute(client);

// Get the receipt to confirm the transfer
const receipt = await txResponse.getReceipt(client);

console.log("Transfer status: " + receipt.status.toString());
Make sure both accounts are associated with the USDC token before transferring.
The amount should be specified in the smallest denomination (e.g., for USDC with 6 decimals, 1 USDC = 1,000,000 units).
Alternatively, you can use command-line tools like yahcli to send USDC:

docker run -it -v $(pwd):/launch gcr.io/hedera-registry/yahcli:0.4.1 -n stabletestnet -p 2 accounts send -d 0.0.2276691 --to <receiver-account-id> --memo "Transfer USDC" 1.23
Here, 0.0.2276691 is the token ID for USDC on testnet, and 1.23 is the amount of USDC to send (with 6 decimals, so 1.23 = 1,230,000 units) Sending fungible HTS units.
If you meant something different by "convert USDC to USDC" (such as cross-chain bridging or swapping between wrapped versions), please clarify your use case.

can you help me create multiple custodial wallets using coinbase developer platform onramp bridging ethereum usdc into hbar usdc
I'm sorry, but the knowledge sources do not contain information about creating multiple custodial wallets using the Coinbase developer platform, nor do they provide details on using Coinbase as an onramp to bridge Ethereum USDC into Hedera (HBAR) USDC.
However, I can provide information on related topics within the Hedera ecosystem:
Custodial Wallets on Hedera: The Hedera Custodians Library allows developers to manage custodial wallets and integrate with custodial services like Fireblocks and DFNS. This library provides a unified interface for managing multiple custodial wallets, but there is no mention of Coinbase integration in the provided sources. You can create and manage multiple custodial wallets by instantiating separate configurations for each wallet and using the library’s API for wallet operations. Example usage is shown in the documentation:

const fireblocksConfig = new FireblocksConfig(/* Fireblocks parameters */);
const dfnsConfig = new DFNSConfig(/* DFNS parameters */);

const fireblocksService = new CustodialWalletService(fireblocksConfig);
const dfnsService = new CustodialWalletService(dfnsConfig);
How to use it
Bridging USDC from Ethereum to Hedera: Bridging assets like USDC between Ethereum and Hedera can be accomplished using interoperability solutions such as LayerZero or Hashport. These platforms facilitate the transfer of tokens across chains, but the sources do not provide a step-by-step guide for using Coinbase as the onramp or for automating this process with custodial wallets. For LayerZero, you can refer to their quickstart guides and examples for bridging tokens, but Coinbase-specific workflows are not covered in the sources LayerZero, Hashport.
Summary:
The knowledge sources do not provide enough information to guide you through creating multiple custodial wallets using the Coinbase developer platform or bridging Ethereum USDC into Hedera USDC via Coinbase. If you need help with custodial wallet management on Hedera or with general bridging solutions (not Coinbase-specific), I can assist further using the available documentation.

convert USDC on Flow to Hedera USDC
I'm sorry, but the knowledge sources do not contain information or instructions on directly converting USDC from the Flow blockchain to USDC on Hedera. The available documentation covers bridging solutions for Hedera with networks like Ethereum and Polygon (using Hashport and LayerZero), but does not mention Flow or provide a cross-chain bridge between Flow and Hedera for USDC or any other asset.
If you are looking to bridge assets between Flow and Hedera, you may need to use an external service or a multi-step process involving an intermediary chain (such as Ethereum), but this is not described in the provided sources. For now, there is no documented, direct Flow-to-Hedera USDC bridge in the referenced materials.

build a smart contract to bridge Stablecoins from a blockchain to Hedera
To build a smart contract to bridge stablecoins from another blockchain to Hedera, you can leverage the LayerZero protocol, which provides cross-chain messaging and bridging capabilities. Specifically, the HTS Connector contract is designed to facilitate bridging tokens from other networks to Hedera as native HTS tokens. Below is an example of such a contract, adapted from the official Hedera documentation:

// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import {OFTCore} from "@layerzerolabs/lz-evm-oapp-v2/contracts/oft/OFTCore.sol";
import "./hts/HederaTokenService.sol";
import "./hts/IHederaTokenService.sol";
import "./hts/KeyHelper.sol";

/**
 * @title HTS Connector
 * @dev HTS Connector is a HTS token that extends the functionality of the OFTCore contract.
 */
abstract contract HTSConnector is OFTCore, KeyHelper, HederaTokenService {
    address public htsTokenAddress;
    bool public finiteTotalSupplyType = true;
    event TokenCreated(address tokenAddress);

    constructor(
        string memory _name,
        string memory _symbol,
        address _lzEndpoint,
        address _delegate
    ) payable OFTCore(8, _lzEndpoint, _delegate) {
        IHederaTokenService.TokenKey[] memory keys = new IHederaTokenService.TokenKey[](1);
        keys[0] = getSingleKey(
            KeyType.SUPPLY,
            KeyValueType.INHERIT_ACCOUNT_KEY,
            bytes("")
        );

        IHederaTokenService.Expiry memory expiry = IHederaTokenService.Expiry(0, address(this), 8000000);
        IHederaTokenService.HederaToken memory token = IHederaTokenService.HederaToken(
            _name, _symbol, address(this), "memo", finiteTotalSupplyType, 5000, false, keys, expiry
        );

        (int responseCode, address tokenAddress) = HederaTokenService.createFungibleToken(
            token, 1000, int32(int256(uint256(8)))
        );
        require(responseCode == HederaTokenService.SUCCESS_CODE, "Failed to create HTS token");

        int256 transferResponse = HederaTokenService.transferToken(tokenAddress, address(this), msg.sender, 1000);
        require(transferResponse == HederaTokenService.SUCCESS_CODE, "HTS: Transfer failed");

        htsTokenAddress = tokenAddress;

        emit TokenCreated(tokenAddress);
    }

    function token() public view returns (address) {
        return htsTokenAddress;
    }

    function approvalRequired() external pure virtual returns (bool) {
        return false;
    }

    // Additional bridging logic (debit, credit, etc.) would be implemented here
}
Key Points:
This contract creates a native HTS token on Hedera and is designed to work with LayerZero’s cross-chain messaging.
The bridging logic (debit, credit, etc.) should be implemented to handle minting and burning tokens as they move between chains.
You must ensure the contract is associated with the token and has the appropriate supply key permissions.
For a full implementation and further details, refer to the LayerZero HTS Connector documentation and example contracts.
Note: All example code is for demonstration purposes and has not been audited. Use at your own risk and always review the latest documentation and security best practices before deploying to mainnet.
